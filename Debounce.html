/* Debouncing is a programming practice used to ensure that time-consuming tasks do not fire so often, 
that it stalls the performance of the web page. In other words, it limits the rate at which a function gets invoked. */

/* Throttle (1 sec): Hello, I am a robot. As long as you keep pinging me, I will keep talking to you, but after exactly 1 second each. 
If you ping me for a reply before a second is elapsed, I will still reply to you at exactly 1 second interval. In other words, I just love to reply at exact intervals.

Debounce (1 sec): Hi, I am that ^^ robot's cousin. As long as you keep pinging me, I am going to remain silent because 
I like to reply only after 1 second is passed since the last time you pinged me. I don't know, 
if it is because I have an attitude problem or because I just don't like to interrupt people. In other words, if you keep asking me for replies before 1 second is elapsed
since your last invocation, you will never get a reply. Yeah yeah...go ahead! call me rude.
