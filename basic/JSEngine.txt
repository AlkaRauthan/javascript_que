NodeJs - Javascript runtime  built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engin. Used to run javascript outside browser.
V8 is written in C++;

- Parsing
    code is parsed and converted to token.
    Syntax parse- Abstract syntax parser
    AST is passed to compliation phase
- Compilation
    Interpeter converts to byte code
- Execution

Garbage collector - 
  Mark and sweep algorithm- 
    All objects are marked as 0 initially (at creation) and in mark phase the objects that will be accessible are marked as 1 (reachable) by a DFS graph traversal.
    During sweep phase, the objects marked with 0 are removed from heap memory. and also all reachable objects are again initialized with 0 (made unreachable) because the algorithm will run again.
    So, it's basically tracing garbage collector concept. :)
