Execution context has two component
1)memory component[variable environment] 
-This is the place where all variables and functions are stored as key value pairs. eg-{key: value ||  n:2;} 

 2)code component[Thread of execution]
-This is the place where code is executed one line at a time

Note-*JavaScript is a synchronous single-threaded language

-Single threaded means JavaScript can execute once command at a time
-Synchronous single-threaded that means JavaScript can execute one command at a time in a specific order.

  1. Memory Creation Phase: This is where all the variables and functions are stored in the memory and all the variables are assigned an undefined placeholder. All the functions keep the entire function code.
variable: undefined
function: function code block

2. Code Execution Block: This is where all the code is run one line at a time in a synchronous manner. All the assignments, calculations and logical part is executed here.
Another thing about functions is that JavaScript ignores the function until it is invoked and when a function a invoked, a new temporary Execution Context is created specially for this function. 
It remains active until the function executes and is deleted after its work is done.
Since we can have multiple nested function calls hence JavaScript uses a Call Stack to maintain the order of functions and Execution Contexts. 
A new EC is inserted when a function is called and popped when that function is executed.

Call Stack goes by many names such as Execution Context Stack, Program Stack, Control Stack etc
