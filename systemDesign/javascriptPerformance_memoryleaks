=> Accidental global variabls
=> forgotten timers or callbacks
=> remove event listeners if not required
=> Out of DOM references
   const a =  document.getElementById("ref1");
    document.removeChild(document.getElementById("ref1");
    even though ref1 element is deleted from the end, a still has its reference
=> Reference obect cycle
=> Forget to disconnect observer
      - resize observer
      - call unobserve/disconnect
      same for IntersectionObserver()
