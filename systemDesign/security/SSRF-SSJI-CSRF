Server side request forgery (SSRF)
Server-side request forgery is a web security vulnerability that allows an attackerto cause the server-side application to make requests to an unintended location.
In a typical SSRF attack, the attacker might cause the server to make a connection to internal-only services within the organization's infrastructure. In other cases,
they may be able to force the server to connect to arbitrary external systems. This could leak sensitive data, such as authorization credentials.

- should validate the url
- lack of whitelisting
- Insufficient access control
- XML External Entity
------------------------------------------------

Server Side javascript injection (SSJI)
Server Side JavaScript injection is the ability for a user to inject code which will in turn be evaluated by the server, and therefore would allow an attacker to
potentially execute arbitrary code under the context of the server and interaction with the filesystem, which may lead to the full compromise.

- Inadequate input validation
- Direct execution of user provided code
- Using dangerous function
- Insecure deserialisation

Cross site request forgery (CSRF)
- someother website click is leading to our bank  for fund transfer

Mitigation  - 
  -Anti CSRF token , in form submit send csrftoken, 
  csrf token we will be receveving from the server injected into html.
  everytime ui is loaded , new csrf token is generated
  - Same site cookies
    .setHeaders('Set-Cookie','SameSite=Strict;Secure')
- Referer based validation
- Use captcha
- CSP Header
