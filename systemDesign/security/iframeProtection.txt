HTML element that loads another HTML page within the document
The iFrame is a common technique to embed webpages, videos, or maps in another web page.
Despite its popularity, iFrames carry several security risks that could let in attackers if we do not take the necessary security steps.

Vulnerability
- Clickhijacking
- Data theft 
- Session & Cookie theft

Mitigation
- X-FRAME-OPTIONS: DENY/ACCEPT
- CSP:frameancestors:self
 Content-Security-Policy; "frameancestors 'none'"
-sandbox="allow-same-origin" // to restrict script execution , should be set on iframe
- for cookie httpOnly= true,secure=true

Defense against framing attacksÂ¶
Attacks like clickjacking and some variants of browser side-channel attacks (xs-leaks) require a malicious website to load the target website in a frame.
Historically the X-Frame-Options header has been used for this, but it has been obsoleted by the frame-ancestors CSP directive.
